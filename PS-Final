**** Abstract ******
The main purpose of this study is to examine the degree to which the Gross Domestic Product (GDP)
per capita, GDP growth rate, the Gross National Income (GNI) per capita, total population, 
government revenue, government total expenditure, and government gross debt predict health 
care expenditure (HCE) as a share of GDP by making a comparison amongst the OECD-Europe countries
between the years of 2000 and 2015. This study aims at disclosing robust explanatory variables 
for HCE growth. Data collected from the Global Welfare (GLOW), the World Bank (WB), 
the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the World Health Organization (WHO), the Organisation 
for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), and Our World in Data is used to 
study the relationship between health care expenditure (the dependent variable) and several 
independent variables. Besides, the study also aims at investigating whether HCE and any of the
government activities have a long-term relationship across different countries. The analysis of 
the data is performed by using the robust fixed effects regression analysis model. Using the 
fixed effects model can help us to analyze the impact of the independent variables that vary 
over time. When it comes to the main findings of this paper, key determinants of the share of HCE 
in GDP over the period 2000-2015 are government revenue as a share of GDP, government expenditure
as a share of GDP, GDP Growth Rate, total population, and GNI per capita according to the results 
of the regression analysis. The results of this study support previous findings that government 
activities are an important determinant of HCE. Besides, it is found through this study that 
government gross debt does not play a role in HCE as a share of GDP.

there is not a necessarily negative relationship between health expenditure as a share of GDP and 
government debt as a share of GDP. The correlation coefficient here is less than 0.7. Therefore, the relationship between the two variables cannot be considered strong. Theoretically, we usually tend to 
hold that if the government increases its debt then the money which can be used for health 
expenditure would become less. Actually, acccording to our analysis above, at least in the OECD-Europe 
countries, it is not true. */

***** Results of this study *****	
*********************************
/* Through the regression analysis above, we can get the results through the robust fixed
effects regression model. First of all, it is surprising that the variable of Gov_Debt_GDP
is not a determinant of HCE as a share of GDP while Gov_Rev_GDP and Gov_Exp_GDP are both 
determinants of HCE as a share of GDP. In Model 4, it shows that an increase of one 
percentage point in Gov_Rev_GDP is associated with a 0.092 percentage point decrease in 
Heal_Exp_GDP controlling for other variables. This negative relationship is statistically 
significant at the p=0.05 level. Besides, it also shows that an increase of one 
percentage point in Gov_Rev_GDP is associated with a 0.10 percentage point increase in 
Heal_Exp_GDP controlling for other variables. Furthermore, GDP Growth Rate, total population, 
and GNI per capita are all determinants of HCE as a share of GDP in the OECD-Europe countries. 
However, GDP growth rate has a negative association with HCE as a share of GDP. Total population 
and GNI per capita are positively correlated with our dependent variable in this study. It is 
shown that an increase of 1 million people is associated with a 0.099 percentage point increase 
in Heal_Exp_GDP and an increase of 1 dollar in GNI_PC is associated with a 0.000086 percentage 
point increase in Heal_Exp_GDP controlling for other variables. Finally, it is shown that
GDP per capita does not make a impact on HCE as a share of GDP either in the original fixed 
effects model or the robust fixed effects model. */

***********************************
**** Limitations of this study ****
***********************************

/* As for this study, the focused research context is the OECD-Europe countries. Most of the 
countries that are members of the OECD are developed countries that have a high-income economy.
Therefore, the first limitation of this study is that it is only based on the data collected from the
European countries. This limits the generalizability of the results of this study. The results may
not apply to other areas such as Asia and Africa if we take account of some political indications.
Besides, all the data is manually merged into a single data set from different sources, and almost
all the data sources are regularly updated on their websites by using their own calculation
methods. For data sources from the World Bank, they are calculated by using the constant U.S.
dollar methodology. Specifically, the particular base year for the World Bank data is 2015 and
all the data is applied backwards and forwards from the 2015 current price value in U.S. dollars
to estimate the corresponding constant price series. Other websites, such as the World Health
Organization, use the 2019 current price or the 2020 current price. The calculation results may be
a little bit different if all the websites adopt the same constant-dollar value to publish their data.
Therefore, future research on this area can use some time-series or cross-sectional data collected
from the same source to study the non-European countries/regions. */
